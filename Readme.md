#moses-caro
Repository of code to use the [tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) program to transcribe the scanned images of Robert Moses' response to Robert Caro. Transcript also available [here](http://zachcp.org/blog/2015/moses_responds_to_caro/)

```
#download and convert the images to text 
make alltext -j 4
```

You will now have a file, **mosesresponse.txt**, that has the transcript. It will need to be edited a fair amount.
